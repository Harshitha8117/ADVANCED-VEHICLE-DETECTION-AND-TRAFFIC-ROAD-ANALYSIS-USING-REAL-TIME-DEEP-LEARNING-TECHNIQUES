Advanced Vehicle Detection and Traffic Road Analysis using Real-Time Deep Learning Techniques

⭐Project Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic management system that can detect vehicles and analyze traffic density in real-time using deep learning techniques. The system uses a camera to capture video frames, detects vehicles, and calculates the average count of vehicles on each road. The system then updates the traffic lights based on the traffic density.

⭐Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv5
- Traffic density analysis and calculation of average vehicle count
- Dynamic traffic light control based on traffic density
- User-friendly interface using Tkinter

⭐Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Torch Hub
- Tkinter
- NumPy

⭐Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ADVANCED-VEHICLE-DETECTION-AND-TRAFFIC-ROAD-ANALYSIS-USING-REAL-TIME-DEEP-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`

⭐Usage

1. Start the application by running `python app.py`
2. Click on the "Start Processing" button to start the vehicle detection and traffic analysis
3. The system will display the video feed and update the traffic lights based on the traffic density
4. Click on the "Stop Detection" button to stop the vehicle detection and traffic analysis

⭐Code Structure

The code is structured into several modules:

- `app.py`: The main application file that contains the Tkinter interface and the vehicle detection and traffic analysis logic
- `model.py`: The file that contains the YOLOv5 model and the vehicle detection logic
